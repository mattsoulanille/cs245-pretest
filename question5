In map/reduce, which is suited well for parallel systems, a function is mapped to (applied to every element of) a list of inputs, and then another function is used to reduce the results (combine them) into the final desired result of the problem. An example problem for which map/reduce would work well is finding the sum of the square roots of a long list of numbers. Square root is the function given to map and addition is the function given to reduce.
